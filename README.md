# Elegant Widget - Visualize fare amount by payment type

It is important for vendors to accept payments in different ways in order to maximize passengers & the yield amount.
This widget visualizes the total fare amount paid to the vendors by different payment types.

## Why is this visualization important?

When catering to a diverse set of passengers, ranging from different age groups to different regions, understanding the amount paid using different payment methods helps in analysing the consumer behavior and helps the vendors to setup the right ways to accept payments.

<b>Example scenario</b>: Jordy is a local taxi driver in Georgia who wants to expand his taxi business across larger part of the country. However, he is not aware of the different payment modes he needs to setup in order to satisfy a large number of passengers.
In this situation, he can use the elegant-widget to understand the payment pattern based on the payment type and setup only those payment types where the transaction amounts are high, because a high total amount collected through a particular payment type would likely mean that a large number of passengers prefer to pay using the said mode.
